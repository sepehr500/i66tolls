<h1 align="center">Should I take I66?</h1>

`Should I Take I66?` is an open source toll monitoring app. The repository is only for the front end only. I am still trying to figure out how to securely open source the backend. 

## Instructions

1. `npm install --global gatsby-cli`
2. run `gatsby develop` in the root of the repository.
